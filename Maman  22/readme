This program is a basic complex numbers calculator that is capable of :
1)summing two complex numbers 
2)substracting two complex numbers
3)multeplying two complex numbers
4)multieplying a complex number with a real number
5)multieplying a complex number with an inmaginary number
6)computing the absalout value of a complex number

The progrem uses 6 varibales, each represents a complex number, the user uses these varibales
to compute his wanted computations by first configuring valueone or more complex variables to the wanted value with the 'read' command.
Complex variables are noted by a capital letter in the rang [A-F], each command must be entered in a single line (only one command per line).
 for help please enter the 'help' command that will print the command menu:
 To exit the program enter 'stop'.
